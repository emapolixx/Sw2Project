# Students & Companies Platform

## Overview
**Students & Companies (S&C)** is a web platform designed to facilitate the connection between **university students searching for internships**, **companies seeking young talent**, and **universities** monitoring the quality of internships.

The main goal is to make the internship application and selection process more **transparent, efficient, and centralized**, reducing complexity for all parties involved:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Architecture & Design
- **Microservices architecture** for scalability, resilience, and independence of components.  
- **RESTful APIs** enabling lightweight communication between services.  
- **API Gateway** managing and routing client requests.  
- **Distributed database** split across Account DB, Internship DB, Selection Process DB, and Notification DB.  
- **User Interfaces** designed with clear mockups for students, companies, and universities:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## What We Learned
Throughout this project we had the opportunity to:
- Apply the complete **Software Engineering cycle**: from the **Requirement Analysis (RASD)** to the **Design Document (DD)**, including architecture, APIs, and UI mockups.  
- Work as a team in a structured way, distributing tasks and tracking the effort spent.  
- Deepen our understanding of:
  - **Requirement Engineering**: phenomena, use cases, functional and non-functional requirements.  
  - **UML modeling**: Use Case, Sequence, State Machine, and Class diagrams.  
  - **Formal Analysis with Alloy** to ensure correctness and consistency.  
  - **Architectural design with microservices** and patterns such as API Gateway and Service Discovery.  
- Improve our technical communication skills through clear and structured documentation:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
